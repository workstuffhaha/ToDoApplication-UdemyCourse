## Todo application

The Todo application was created using ASP.NET WebAssembly, C#, Razor, and HTML. The user interface was built with HTML, Razor, and Bootstrap, while dynamic functionality was implemented using C#. The application was refactored to follow object-oriented programming principles, incorporating separation of concerns and encapsulation. Extension methods were utilized to simplify the code and reduce bloat. Razor events in the HTML were seamlessly connected with C# code blocks to enhance interactivity. Exception handling was added, and the code was thoroughly debugged to ensure reliability. Finally, a GitHub repository was created, and the code was pushed for version control and collaboration.
